# Business-loan-calculator
This is a business loan calculator i created as a personal project for myself in HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT

It calculates the initial amount you want to borrow and also the interest payable 

and It has inputs where the user can change the amount 

It also has a chart function where it shows the amount borrowed and also the total interest payable 

there is also a function where if you press the button above the chart it will only show the total amount borrowed and if you press the other button it will show the total interest payable 

there is also a button to hide the chart 

if you hover the cursor over the chart it will show the amount depending on which side of the chart you hover over
